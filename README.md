# HOW TO RUN:
install npm if you have not yet on your machine by doing an install script with your OS's package manager
for example (ubuntu):
sudo apt install nodejs npm

and then, after nodejs and npm are done installing, cd into CollegeMap/college-map and run:
npm install 

then, to automate setting up the database, run:
chmod +x run-db.sh

after that set up, to start the app, do:

./run-db.sh

then, open another terminal instance keeping the last one open and run 

npm run dev

make sure that you run these commands while inside /college-map/!

ctrl click the link that pops up in the terminal, and you can see the web app in full!

be sure to run docker stop college-map-db when you are done with the app!
